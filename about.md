Over the past four years, I have gained experience in numerical simulation, primarily within the scope of my PhD program at TU Wien, as well as at the Wigner Research Centre for Physics. This includes continuum simulation using differential equations and using a global optimiser to infer its model parameters.
I also used deep learning to substitute ODE numerical integration with a physics-informed neural network. I've also contributed to the MMonCa kinetic Monte-Carlo simulator.
In 2021, I had a computational geometry side project to simulate ray tracing through free-form lenses using Bézier-triangle interpolated meshes.
